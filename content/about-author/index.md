Hi, my name is **Patrick Pacher**.  

I'm a Full-Stack Software developer with a strong background on IT Security. I'm managing the IT and software landscape of the [Veterinary Clinic in Dobersberg, Austria](//tierklinikdobersberg.at).

I'm passionate about technology in general and paticular about Linux ([Archlinux](https://archlinux.org) as the distribution of my choice), [OSS Development](//github.com/ppacher) (*mainly* Go, HTML/JS/CSS and Angular), DevOps, Cluster-Management (Hashicorp Stack), Automation (Ansible) and Privacy.  

For our veterinary clinic I'm developing and maintaining a [bunch of projects](//github.com/tierklinik-dobersberg) that take care of common or supportive tasks regarding executive management and IT.
 
In addition to my work at the clinic I'm working with [@Safing](//safing.io) where I'm mainly progressing the free [Portmaster Application Firewall](//safing.io/portmaster) ([Github Repo](//github.com/safing/portmaster)). If you don't know that yet, you should definitely give it a try! *(Disclaimer: it's still Alpha quality software but already works pretty well).*

Aside from my work-career I'm a happily married husband and proud father (of soon two kids). ❤️
