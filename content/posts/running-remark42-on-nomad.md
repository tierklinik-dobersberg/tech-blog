In this post we'll show you how to run the privacy focused [Remark42](https://remark42.com/) commenting engine on a
Hashicorp Nomad cluster and integrate it into a static website built by [Hugo](/tags/hugo/). We'll enable social logins using Github
and manage those credentials using Vault. The setup described here is similar to the setup used for this website.
