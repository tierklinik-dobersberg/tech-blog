Welcome to `tech.dobersberg.vet`, the new Tech & IT blog of the [veterinary clinic in Dobersberg, Lower Austria](//tierklinikdobersberg.at).

<!--more-->

We will use this blog to talk about certain aspects of the IT and software landscape that we use and run at the clinic. You will find content about running a [Hashicorp Nomad](//nomadproject.io) cluster on [Hetzner cloud](//hetzner.de), using Ansible to automate server and client setups as well as blog series for in-house software development like our **CIS - Clinic Information Services** and what you can do with it.

The primary motivation about maintaining and creating an IT blog is for documentation and reference purposes of your own. Infrastructure has grown to a size where good documentation is a must have and this blog will play it's role in the documentation effort. 

This website has just been launched so not much content is available at the time of writing. In the meantime, you can check [our website](//tierklinikdobersberg.at), read more [About the author](/about-author/) or inspect our [Privacy Policy and Imprint](/about/).
